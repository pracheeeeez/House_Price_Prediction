# House Price Prediction Model with XGBoost Regression
This repository contains a Python house price prediction model implementation using the California housing dataset from scikit-learn. The model leverages the powerful XGBoost regression algorithm to predict house prices based on various features accurately.

# Overview
Predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real estate industry and has wide-ranging applications, from assisting homebuyers in making informed decisions to aiding real estate agents and property developers in pricing strategies. This project aims to build a robust and reliable house price prediction model using machine learning techniques.

# Dataset
The California housing dataset, readily available in scikit-learn, is utilized for training and evaluating the model. This dataset contains median income, housing median age, average rooms per household, average bedrooms per room, population, households, and median house value for California districts.

# Model Architecture
The model employs XGBoost regression, a powerful gradient-boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling structured data. XGBoost's ability to handle missing values, feature importance analysis, and ensemble learning makes it an ideal choice for this prediction task.

# Usage
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the California housing dataset, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
Model Training: Train the XGBoost regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
# Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- XGBoost

# How to Run
To run the house price prediction model:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

# Results
The performance of the house price prediction model is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared. The MAE and R-squared over the testing datset are 0.310 and 0.833 respectively.The results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict house prices based on the given features.
